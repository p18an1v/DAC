in collection api there are some classes which are thread safe (synchronized non-static methods) and other classes are non-thread safe.

we can make non-thread safe classes as thread-safe.
e.g. we can make ArrayList which is non-thread safe as thread safe. 

List<Integer>mylist=new ArrayList<Integer>();

List<Integer>mylist1=Collections.synchronizedList(mylist);


how to convert HashMap which is non-thread safe to thread safe

Map<String,Integer>mymap=new HashMap<>();
Map<String,Integer>mymap1=Collections.synchronizedMap(mymap);
