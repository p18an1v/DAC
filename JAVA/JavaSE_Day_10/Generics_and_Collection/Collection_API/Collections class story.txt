Collections class has got all the static methods as algorithms.
When java founders were thinking of providing algorithms, they realized that algorithms cannot be state methods (instance methods) as they are just utility methods. So they decided to go for static methods. The problem was collection api hierarchy has all the interfaces at the top. They could not add static methods (algorithms) inside any interface as static method were not allowed in the interface then. After a long discussion they came to the conclusion that they would create a separate class to accommodate all the static methods as algorithms and that class was "Collections".
