1) accept 10 numbers from user and add them inside the ArrayList.
using ListIterator display all the numbers bidirectionally.

2) on the developer side:
	create a generic class which can accept any type
		with setters , getters and toString methods.
	create necessary jar files and  documentation.

on client side 
	create the object of above generic class and invoke its setters , getters and display the object.
  

3) create LinkedList with the values 10,20,30 and 40.
display it.
now insert 500 in the beginning.
	insert 400 at 2nd position.
	add 1000 at the end.
display the list again.

4) add 5 numbers inside CopyOnWriteArrayList and show how can you add one more number at the same time of traversal through its iterator.


5) create a class MyNum with
		private int num;
		parameterized constructor

	
Demo class with main
	create 4 objects of MyNum by passing different integers.
	store these 4 objects inside "ArrayList"
	and now store that ArrayList inside file system.
	
	read ArrayList from file and traverse it using Iterator.

6)
Create a Student class with fields:

id (int)
name (String)
age (int)
marks (double)
Constructor & toString() method

Use an ArrayList<Student> to store student records.

Implement the following operations in the main function.

Add a student
Display all students
Search for a student by ID


7) 
Create an interface Product with a method displayDetails().

Create two classes:

Electronics and Groceries 

Both should implement Product.

Store objects of both the classes in a ArrayList<Product>.

store ArrayList in the file , then read ArrayList from the file and display.



8) create a class "MyClass".
create 5 different objects of it.
add them in a ArrayList.
store ArrayList in file.
Now open a file, read ArrayList and display all objects.

9) create a HashMap.
store  prn no. and students name of 10 students inside the HashMap.
now write this HashMap inside the file and read also. After reading display it using iterator.

10) create a hierarchy as follows
	interface Game- play() method
	Derive at least 3 classes from it. ( Cricket, Chess and Football )
Now Create generic class which can take Game type (i.e. any sub type of Game) as parameter.
In this class try to call the play() method of the class which is passed to it.


11) maintain ICC ranking of at least 5 batsmen in the "HashMap".
list should be maintain as "rank" "name"
e.g. "1" "Rohit Sharma".
Now ask any rank bet'n 1 to 5 from user. ( user input).
if user asks for a particular rank , retrieve batsman name for that rank from the HashMap.

12)
Create a base class Animal with makeSound().

Create subclasses Dog and Cat, each overriding makeSound().

Store objects of Dog and Cat in an ArrayList<Animal>.
Now traverse the ArrayList using iterator and call makeSound() dynamically.
