enum is internally derived from java.lang.Enum which is an abstract class (without any abstract method). so enum cannot be derived from some other class but it can implement interface/s.

 a class can have enum/s inside it the way we have nested class.

enum cannot be defined inside the method as enum cannot be local.

enum was introduced in Java 5

enum is a special type of datatype which is a collection of constants.

actually enum is just like a class that can have constant, method and a private constructor. ( private constructor is added implicitly by the compiler)

because of private constructor we cannot instantiate enum with "new" keyword.

enum constants are by default "public", "final" and "static"
