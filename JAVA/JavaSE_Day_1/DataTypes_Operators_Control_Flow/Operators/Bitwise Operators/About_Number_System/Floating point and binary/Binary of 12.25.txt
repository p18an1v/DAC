12.25

how will you find out the binary of above number

12 is integer part and .25 is a fractional part.
The rule is 
for integer part , you've to devide integer part ( 12 ) by 2 till you get quotient as 0 and then consider all the remainders in a "reverse order".
for a fractional part, you've to multiply by 2 till you get result as 0 and then consider "the straight order or same order".


       12
2	6  0
2       3  0
2       1  1
2       0  1

reverse order

0 1 1 0 0 


.25

.25 * 2

	0.50
	
	
	1.00 

you have to stop here as after a dot ( . ) , there are zeros

so if you check integer part here (look at the left side of dot), the order is
	0 1

already we've calculated binary of 12
	0 1 1 0 0.0 1
