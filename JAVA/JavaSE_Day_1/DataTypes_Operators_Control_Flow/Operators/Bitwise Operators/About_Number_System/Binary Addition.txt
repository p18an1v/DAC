0+0  = 0

1+0  = 1

	it's 1 because 
		1+0   is 1
	and binary of 1 is 1
		i.e.  2[0] * 1    is 1

0+1  = 1

	it's 1 because 
		0+1   is 1
	and binary of 1 is 1
		i.e.  2[0] * 1    is 1

1+1  = 10 

	it's 10 because
		actually   1+1 is  2  but binary of 2  is  10
			i.e.
			2[1]* 1  is  2  and  2[0] * 0  is 0
