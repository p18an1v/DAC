The abstraction you see in Javadocs falls under behavioral abstraction. Javadocs focus on providing a high-level description of what a class, method, or constructor is supposed to do, while hiding the internal code or the implementation details of how it performs its task.

This allows developers to interact with the code at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on functionality rather than the complexity of its internal workings.

Why Is Javadoc Considered a Form of Abstraction?

Hides Implementation Details: Javadocs focus on what the code is doing, but they hide the internal logic or how it performs those tasks. This is essentially abstracting away the complexity of the code.

Provides High-Level View: Javadocs give a high-level overview of the code's functionality, making it easier for developers to understand how to use a class or method without needing to read through the implementation code.

Encourages Use of Interfaces: Javadocs are often associated with documenting APIs or interfaces, where the user interacts with the methods and the behavior rather than dealing with implementation specifics.

Javadoc abstraction is related to documentation-level abstraction and can be classified as a type of behavioral abstraction.

Javadocs are documentation comments in Java that describe the functionality of classes, methods, and fields, providing a high-level overview of the system's API. These documents focus on what the class or method does rather than how it does it.

What is shown in Javadocs?

Class names
Constructors and their parameters
Method names, return types, and parameters
Descriptions of what the methods and classes are intended to do
Expected behavior of methods (such as preconditions and postconditions)


What is not shown in Javadocs?

Implementation details of methods and fields.
Internal code that performs the tasks described in the method signatures.

Thus, Javadocs abstract away the internal implementation and provide only the interface or behavioral description of the classes and methods.
