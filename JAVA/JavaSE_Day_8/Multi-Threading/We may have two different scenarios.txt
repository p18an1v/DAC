we may have 2 scenarios

a) we would like to have one thread at a time to work and only when it finishes , the other thread should work.

	banking application
		one thread should complete the job of depositing money
	and then only the other thread can withdraw

		synchronized - keyword



b) we would like to have all our threads to work simultaneously.

	server side application where server would like to have all the clients( threads) connecting simultaneously.
		sleep - method
