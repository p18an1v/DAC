in the constant pool
			#1 = Methodref   // java/lang/Object."<init>":()V

inside
	public DemoClass();
				invokespecial #1

it means invoke the default constructor of Object class as Object class is the parent of DemoClass


inside main
		new           #7

in the constant pool
		#7 = Class  Student

so "new  #7" means to instantiate Student class.


inside main
		invokespecial #9 
in the constant pool
		#9 = Methodref   // Student."<init>":()V

so, invokespecial   #9 means to call the constructor of Student.


in the main
			ldc           #10    
     invokevirtual #12   

in the constant pool
		#10 = String   // Rohit          
   #12 = Methodref   // Student.setName:(Ljava/lang/String;)V  

so "ldc  #10" means retrieve "Rohit" from constant pool table and place it on the operand stack.

"invokevirtual #12" means invoke a method "setName" by passing "Rohit" which is available inside operand stack.

inside main
		getstatic     #16

inside constant pool
		#16 = Fieldref // java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;

so, "getstatic  #16"  means access "out" which is a static member of System and of type "PrintStream"


inside main
		invokevirtual #22

inside constant pool
		#22 = Methodref  // Student.getName:()Ljava/lang/String;

so, "invokevirtual    #22" means invoke "getName()"


inside main
		invokevirtual       #26 
inside constant pool
		#26 = Methodref   // java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V

so, "invokevirtual   #26" means invoke "println()" method.
