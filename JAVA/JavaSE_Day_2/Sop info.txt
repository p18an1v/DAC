/*command line arguments

	arguments given to running program.
	arguments passed to main function.
in java , main function is always ready to accept command line arguments.*/

public static void main(String args[])
	

public - so that main can be accessed from anywhere.

static - so that jvm need not create the object of class in which main function is defined.

void - main is not expected to return anything.

String args[] - in java main should be always ready to accept command line arguments.



Explain        System.out.println("hello");


System.out.println("hello")




class System
{
	public static PrintStream out;
	
}
class PrintStream
{
	public void print(){}
	public void println(){}
}

explanation:
		a) we want to print "hello"
				so we write ("hello")
		b) using println() method we can print "hello"
				so we write println("hello");
		c) println() is a non-static method of PrintStream , hence it needs to be called using reference of PrintStream.
		d) do we have any reference of PrintStream available? 
				yes it's "out"
					so we write   out.println("hello");

		e) what is "out"?
				"out" is a public static member of "System" class, hence we write

							System.out

		so that's why we have
					System.out.println("hello");
