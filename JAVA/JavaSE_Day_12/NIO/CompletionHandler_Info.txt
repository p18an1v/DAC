public interface CompletionHandler<V,A>

A handler for consuming the result of an asynchronous I/O operation.

The asynchronous channels defined in this package allow a completion handler to be specified to consume the result of an asynchronous operation. 
The "completed()" method is invoked when the I/O operation completes successfully. 

The "failed()" method is invoked if the I/O operations fails.
